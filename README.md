# ImageReader - OCR (Object Character Recognition) for PDF Reading Automation

Object Character Recognition (OCR) implemented with Google's Tesseract. This program utilizes Google's OCR application to read text directly from images. The purpose of this project is to retrieve key information from images or pdfs and to then organize this information into an exel file for later use. This program is ideal for pdf automation by those who see a high volume of pdf data and spend most of their time reading/typing out this information. This program is tailored toward one specific example but can be easily tailored for your own personal use.
